dumb
## credit thing
oh also i didn't create the bihashmap i googled and someone suggested this to someone else in the stackoverflow whereabouts so i OBTAINED via copy paste although desafortunadamente i forgot where i got it from

## weird testing methods
for testing i usually use [this website's interactive rubik's cube](https://ruwix.com/online-rubiks-cube-solver-program/) primarily because it's hyperimmediate meanwhile ALL the other ones have 5 second long animations per turn

I utilize AHK to create a simple macro to iterate through all elements quickly, as I don't want to press a key 400 times

## example AHK script utilized
```autohotkey
^j::
Loop, 84
{
  Send, dlf
  Sleep 10
}
return
```

## bugs
bugs annoyent please informent if can do or if do can then fix epicques

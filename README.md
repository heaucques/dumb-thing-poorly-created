dumb

## weird testing methods
for testing i usually use [this website's interactive rubik's cube](https://ruwix.com/online-rubiks-cube-solver-program/) primarily because it's hyperimmediate meanwhile ALL THE OTHER ONES HAVE 5 SECOND LONG ANIMATIONS

I utilize AHK to create a simple macro to iterate through all elements quickly, as I don't want to press a key 400 times

## example AHK script utilized
```autohotkey
^j::
Loop, 84
{
  Send, dlf
  Sleep 10
}
return
```

## bugs
bugs annoyent please fix if can do
